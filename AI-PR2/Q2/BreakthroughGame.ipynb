    "The Breakthrough game is a two-player strategy board game played on an 6x6 grid. The objective of the game is to move your pieces from one end of the board to the other before your opponent does.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- The board consists of a 6x6 grid with alternating dark and light squares.\n",
    "- Each player starts with 12 pieces placed on their respective sides of the board.\n",
    "- The pieces are initially arranged in two rows, with each row containing 6 pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Piece Movement\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each player can only move their own pieces.\n",
    "- Pieces can move diagonally or straight forward one square at a time.\n",
    "- Pieces cannot move backward or sideways.\n",
    "- Pieces can capture their opponent's pieces by moving diagonally forward and landing on a square occupied by an opponent's piece.\n",
    "- Captured pieces are removed from the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game End\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a player successfully moves one of their pieces to the opposite end of the board, they win the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- Players can only capture the opponent's piece if its in their diagonal forward squares and they cannot have two or more pieces of their color in the same square.\n",
    "- Players take turns moving their pieces.\n",
    "- Players must make a move on their turn, and they cannot skip their turn.\n",
    "- If a player has multiple legal moves, they can choose which piece to move."
